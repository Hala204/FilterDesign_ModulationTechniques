# FilterDesign_ModulationTechniques
This repository contains MATLAB code implementations and Simulink models for various filter design and amplitude modulation techniques. The projects included are based on specific filter families like Butterworth and Chebyshev filters, and various amplitude modulation methods such as DSB-SC, DSB-LC, SSB-LC, VSB, and signal multiplexing.
